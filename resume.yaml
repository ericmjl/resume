       - Built [Flu Forecaster](https://fluforecaster.herokuapp.com), a machine learning-powered system that forecasts flu sequences six months out, to better prepare for manufacturing of vaccine strains.
        - Implemented a variational autoencoder (deep learning model) to learn a continuous representation of 14,455 influenza hemagglutinin protein sequences, and trained a Gaussian process model on the continuous representation to predict new flu sequences.
        - Developed interactive blog post using Flask and Bootstrap, and deployed to Heroku and GitHub.
        - Led peer workshops on [web development](https://github.com/ericmjl/minimal-flask-example), deep learning and [code style](https://github.com/ericmjl/pycodestyle-tutorial).

    - company: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
      title: ScD Candidate
      location: Cambridge MA
      timeperiod: August 2011-May 2017

        - Developed a scalable, network-based phylogenetic heuristic algorithm for detecting reassortant influenza viruses using 18,632 fully sequenced virus genomes that improved our capacity to detect reassortment events by two orders of magnitude.
        - The algorithm was used in a lead-author study (published in [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5335.full)) providing systematic evidence that genome shuffling is important for host switching, and a co-authored study (published in [Ecology Letters](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12629/abstract)) that showed that reassortment is a strategy for viral gene persistence in wild animal reservoirs.
        - Contributed [reproducible data analysis](https://github.com/runstadler-lab/Seal-H3N8-Image-Analysis) for colleagues through fluorescent image quantification and genomic analysis in studies that refuted binding properties of novel influenza viruses.
        - Performed [Bayesian statistical modelling](https://github.com/ericmjl/mia-stats/blob/master/sterilization/sterilization.ipynb) for colleagues testing the efficacy of phone sterilization tools.
        - Delivered tutorials and talks on Network Analysis and Bayesian statistical methods at annual Python conferences, including PyCon, SciPy, and PyData.

        - Investigated the role of T cells in intestinal inflammation and fibrosis in a Salmonella typhimurium-induced model of gut inflammation, leading to First Prize Poster ([Rising Stars of Research 2008](https://www.evernote.com/l/AANJS_A9iKZAMLGYqJDduTxiiI2ZNf43zHM)) and Best Talk (Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference 2009) awards.
        - Co-founded the [first UBC International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) team](http://2009.igem.org/Team:British_Columbia), where we achieved a Gold status standing in our first year of competition.
        - Served as a [Peer Academic Coach](https://science.ubc.ca/students/spac), guiding first- and second-year students towards academic success through building good habits on learning strategies and time management.
