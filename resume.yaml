      - Developed a scalable, network-based phylogenetic heuristic algorithm for detecting reassortant influenza viruses using 18,632 fully sequenced virus genomes that improved our capacity to detect reassortment events by two orders of magnitude.
      - The algorithm was used in a lead-author study (published in [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5335.full)) providing systematic evidence that genome shuffling is important for host switching, and a co-authored study (published in [Ecology Letters](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12629/abstract)) that showed that reassortment is a strategy for viral gene persistence in wild animal reservoirs.
      - Contributed [reproducible data analysis](https://github.com/runstadler-lab/Seal-H3N8-Image-Analysis) for colleagues through fluorescent image quantification and genomic analysis in studies that refuted binding properties of novel influenza viruses.
      - Performed [Bayesian statistical modelling](https://github.com/ericmjl/mia-stats/blob/master/sterilization/sterilization.ipynb) for colleagues testing the efficacy of phone sterilization tools.
      - Delivered tutorials and talks on Network Analysis and Bayesian statistical methods at annual Python conferences, including PyCon, SciPy, and PyData.
